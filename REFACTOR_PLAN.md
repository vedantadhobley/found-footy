# Refactor: Validation & Deduplication Overhaul

**Branch:** `refactor/valid-deduplication`  
**Parent:** `feature/grafana-logging`  
**Started:** 2026-02-13

## Current Status

| Phase | Status | Progress |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Phase 1: AI Clock Extraction | ✅ Complete | 10/10 tasks — deployed at `4dcf3bc` |
| Phase 2: Verification-Scoped Dedup | 🔧 In Progress | 3/6 tasks done |

**Phase 1 — Deployed (2026-02-16):**
- ✅ Structured 5-field vision prompt (SOCCER / SCREEN / CLOCK / ADDED / STOPPAGE_CLOCK)
- ✅ `parse_response()` returns dict with all 5 fields
- ✅ Per-field parsers: `parse_clock_field()`, `parse_added_field()`, `parse_stoppage_clock_field()`, `compute_absolute_minute()`
- ✅ `validate_timestamp()` accepts structured frame dicts, returns `(bool, int|None, str)`
- ✅ `validate_video_is_soccer()` takes `event_minute`/`event_extra`, folds timestamp rejection into `is_valid`
- ✅ `event_minute`/`event_extra` wired through entire chain: monitor → twitter → download → validate
- ✅ Verification fields (`clock_verified`, `extracted_minute`, `timestamp_verified`) attached to `video_info` and passed to MongoDB
- ✅ `VideoFields` expanded (6 → 17 constants), `S3Video` updated, `DownloadStats` has `timestamp_rejected`
- ✅ 58 unit tests passing (updated for structured dicts + 4 new test classes)
- ✅ Workers rebuilt and running (`docker compose up -d --build worker`)

**Phase 2 — In Progress:**
- ✅ Split `deduplicate_videos()` calls by `timestamp_verified` at the workflow level — parallel via `asyncio.gather()`
- ✅ Merge parallel dedup results (verified + unverified pools)
- ✅ Add `timestamp_verified` as primary ranking key in `recalculate_video_ranks()`
- ⬜ Integration tests, live data validation, deploy & monitor

## Problem Statement

The current pipeline has two major quality issues:

1. **Deduplication is unreliable** — perceptual hash matching produces false positives (e.g. the Szoboszlai meme replacing a real goal clip) and the "longer = better" replacement logic makes it worse. Dedup needs to be **disabled** until we have a reliable verification layer.

2. **No timestamp verification** — we accept any video that "looks like soccer" but never verify it's showing the *right moment* in the match. A 30th-minute goal clip and a 75th-minute goal clip from the same match are indistinguishable to the current pipeline.

---

## Phase 1: AI Timestamp Extraction (NEW VERIFICATION LAYER)

### Concept

Broadcast soccer footage almost always displays a game clock (e.g. `30:00`, `47:12`). We can extract this timestamp from the frames we're already sending to the vision model, then compare it to the API-reported event time.

### How the game clock works

- Game clock format: `MM:SS` (e.g. `30:00`, `45:00`)
- Added time continues counting: `45+2` in the API = `47:xx` on the broadcast clock
- **The API reports the minute AFTER the goal happened.** So API time `elapsed=45, extra=2` (which we calculate as minute 47) means the goal actually occurred at minute **46:xx** in the broadcast clock.

### What we have from the API

From `event.time`:
- `elapsed`: int — The base minute (e.g. `45`)
- `extra`: int | None — Additional time (e.g. `2`)

The "broadcast minute" = `elapsed + (extra or 0)` — this is the minute as it would appear on the game clock, except the API reports +1 from when the goal actually happened.

So: **expected broadcast minute = elapsed + (extra or 0) - 1**

### Current AI validation flow

```
validate_video_is_soccer(file_path, event_id)
├── Extract frame at 25% of video duration
├── Extract frame at 75% of video duration  
├── Call vision LLM on each frame with prompt:
│   "Is this SOCCER? Is this a SCREEN recording?"
├── If 25% and 75% disagree → extract 50% frame as tiebreaker
└── Return: {is_valid, is_soccer, is_screen_recording, confidence}
```

Currently the function takes only `file_path` and `event_id`. The event minute is not passed down.

### Proposed change: Add timestamp extraction to vision calls

The 25% and 75% frames are the key ones for timestamp extraction — they represent early and late points in the video. The game clock should be visible in most broadcast frames.

**CRITICAL:** We do NOT ask the AI to parse/convert the time. Broadcast clock formats are wildly inconsistent, and we need deterministic parsing logic. Instead, we ask the AI to report **exactly what it sees** on screen, and WE parse it.

### Broadcast clock format categories

Broadcast clocks fall into 5 distinct format categories. Our parser must handle all of them.

#### Category A: Running match clock (most common)

The main clock runs continuously from 0:00. No period indicator. This is the simplest format — the minutes value IS the absolute minute.

| Seen on screen | Parsed minute |
|---------------|---------------|
| `34:12` | 34 |
| `84:28` | 84 |
| `112:54` | 112 |

#### Category B: Period indicator + time

Some broadcasts prefix the clock with a period indicator (`2H`, `1H`, `ET`, `AET`). The time shown may be **relative** to the period start or **absolute** from match start — we detect which using thresholds.

| Seen on screen | Relative or absolute? | Parsed minute |
|---------------|----------------------|---------------|
| `1H 35:00` | Relative (but no offset needed) | 35 |
| `2H 5:00` | Relative (5 < 45, add 45) | 50 |
| `2H 67:00` | Absolute (67 >= 45, don't add) | 67 |
| `ET 04:04` | Relative (4 <= 30, add 90) | 94 |
| `AET 04:04` | Same as ET | 94 |
| `ET 15:00` | Relative (15 <= 30, add 90) | 105 |
| `ET 102:53` | Absolute (102 >= 90, don't add) | 102 |

#### Category C: Compact stoppage time

The base period minute and added minutes are shown with a `+` separator. No colon before the `+`. The base is always explicit (45, 90, 105) so the result is always `base + added`.

| Seen on screen | Parsed minute |
|---------------|---------------|
| `45+2` | 47 |
| `45+2:30` | 47 (`:30` is seconds, ignored) |
| `90+3` | 93 |
| `90+3:15` | 93 |
| `105+2` | 107 |

#### Category D: Broadcast stoppage display (frozen base + sub-clock)

**This is the format seen in our Tolisso test: `45:00 +2 00:43`**

Many broadcasts freeze the main clock at the period boundary (45:00 or 90:00) and display a separate sub-clock counting elapsed stoppage time. The format is:

```
BASE:SS  +TOTAL_ALLOCATED  ELAPSED_MM:SS
45:00    +2                00:43
```

- `45:00` = main clock frozen at end of regulation half
- `+2` = referee allocated 2 minutes of stoppage
- `00:43` = 43 seconds of the 2 minutes have elapsed so far

**The actual match minute = BASE_MINUTES + ELAPSED_MINUTES from the sub-clock.**

| Seen on screen | Base | Sub-clock elapsed | Parsed minute |
|---------------|------|-------------------|---------------|
| `45:00 +2 00:43` | 45 | 0 min 43s → 0 | 45 |
| `45:00 +3 01:30` | 45 | 1 min 30s → 1 | 46 |
| `90:00 +4 02:17` | 90 | 2 min 17s → 2 | 92 |
| `90:00 +5 03:45` | 90 | 3 min 45s → 3 | 93 |
| `90:00 +6 05:12` | 90 | 5 min 12s → 5 | 95 |

**Why this matters:** Without parsing the sub-clock, `90:00 +4 02:17` would be parsed as minute 90 (from the `90:00`). If the API says the goal was at minute 92, that's a diff of 2 — outside our ±1 tolerance → **false timestamp rejection**.

#### Category E: Base time + stoppage (no space, colon in base)

Similar to C but the base includes `:SS`. No space between the base time and the `+`.

| Seen on screen | Parsed minute |
|---------------|---------------|
| `90:00+3:15` | 93 |
| `45:00+2` | 47 |

#### Non-parseable values

| Seen on screen | Parsed |
|---------------|--------|
| `HT` | None (half time) |
| `FT` | None (full time) |
| `NONE` | None (AI: no clock visible) |
| `None` / empty | None |

**Key insight:** The AI should report the RAW text it sees. Our code parses it.

### Structured Extraction Approach (RECOMMENDED)

**Discovery (2026-02-16):** Testing on 7 real production videos (13+ frames across stoppage time and regular time goals) revealed that the vision model can reliably decompose broadcast scoreboards into **three separate visual elements**. This structured extraction is significantly more robust than asking for a single combined clock string.

#### Why three fields instead of one

The single `CLOCK` field approach asked the AI to concatenate multiple visual elements into one string (e.g. `"90:00 +4 03:57"`), which created two problems:
1. **Inconsistent formatting** — the AI might join elements with spaces, no spaces, different orderings, or omit parts entirely
2. **Complex regex parsing** — we needed 5 distinct pattern categories (D→E→C→A/B) with priority ordering to handle every possible concatenation

The structured approach eliminates both problems by asking for each element separately.

#### The three fields

Broadcast scoreboards display up to three distinct time elements:

| Field | Visual Element | What It Shows | Example Values |
|-------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| **CLOCK** | Primary match timer | Running time or frozen at period boundary | `48:50`, `96:46`, `90:00` |
| **ADDED** | Stoppage allocation badge | Total stoppage minutes allocated by referee | `+4`, `+6`, or `NONE` |
| **STOPPAGE_CLOCK** | Stoppage sub-timer | Running elapsed time within stoppage period | `03:57`, `1:30`, or `NONE` |

#### Three broadcast types and how they decompose

| Broadcast Type | CLOCK | ADDED | STOPPAGE_CLOCK | How to Compute Absolute Minute |
|----------------|-------|-------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| **Regular time** | Running (e.g. `48:50`) | NONE | NONE | `clock_minutes` directly |
| **Running-clock stoppage** | Continues past boundary (e.g. `96:46`) | Present (e.g. `+6`) | NONE | `clock_minutes` directly |
| **Frozen-clock stoppage** | Frozen at boundary (e.g. `90:00`) | Present (e.g. `+4`) | Running (e.g. `03:57`) | `clock_minutes + stoppage_minutes` |

The ADDED field is never needed for minute computation — it's a **cross-check signal** against `api_extra`.

#### Evidence from live testing

Tested across production videos with the structured prompt. Results were 100% accurate:

**Stoppage time goals (all correctly show ADDED):**
| Goal | Frame | CLOCK | ADDED | STOPPAGE_CLOCK | Computed |
|------|-------|-------|-------|----------------|----------|
| Fofana (Lens) 90+5 | 10% | 90:00 | +4 | 03:57 | 93 |
| Fofana (Lens) 90+5 | 25% | 90:00 | +4 | 03:57 | 93 |
| Fofana (Lens) 90+5 | 50% | 90:00 | +4 | 03:57 | 93 |
| Fofana (Lens) 90+5 | 75% | 90:00 | +4 | 04:01 | 94 |
| Fofana (Lens) 90+5 | 90% | 90:00 | +4 | 04:03 | 94 |
| Sarr (Palace) 45+2 | 25% | 46:19 | +4' | — | 46 |
| Sarr (Palace) 45+2 | 75% | 46:29 | +4 | — | 46 |
| Havertz (Arsenal) 90+7 | 25% | 96:46 | +6 | — | 96 |
| Havertz (Arsenal) 90+7 | 75% | 97:09 | +6 | — | 97 |

| Moreira (Porto) 90+4 | 75% | 90:00 | +4 | 3:11 | 93 |
| Williams (Bilbao) 90+6 | 25% | 95:24 | +7 | — | 95 |
| Williams (Bilbao) 90+6 | 75% | 95:28 | +7 | — | 95 |

**Regular time goals (all correctly report NONE):**
| Goal | Frame | CLOCK | ADDED | STOPPAGE_CLOCK |
|------|-------|-------|-------|----------------|
| Vini Jr (Real Madrid) 15' | 25% | 15:27 | NONE | NONE |
| Vini Jr (Real Madrid) 15' | 75% | 15:27 | NONE | NONE |
| de Frutos (Leganés) 49' | 25% | 48:50 | NONE | NONE |
| de Frutos (Leganés) 49' | 75% | 48:50 | NONE | NONE |
| Alvarez (City) 65' | 25% | 64:36 | NONE | NONE |
| Alvarez (City) 65' | 75% | 64:36 | NONE | NONE |

#### How this simplifies parsing

**Before (single CLOCK):** 5 regex patterns in priority order, handling every possible concatenation:
- Pattern D: `(\d+):(\d{2})\s*\+\s*\d+\s+(\d+):(\d{2})` (broadcast stoppage display)
- Pattern E: `(\d+):(\d{2})\+(\d+)(?::(\d{2}))?` (base+stoppage no space)
- Pattern C: `(\d+)\s*\+\s*(\d+)` (compact stoppage)
- Patterns A/B: `(\d+):(\d{2})` with period indicator logic

**After (structured fields):** Each field parsed independently with trivial logic:
- **CLOCK:** Only needs Patterns A/B (plain MM:SS with optional period indicator). Pattern C kept as fallback for compact broadcasts. **Patterns D and E are eliminated entirely.**
- **ADDED:** `re.search(r'\+\s*(\d+)', value)` — just extract the number
- **STOPPAGE_CLOCK:** `re.match(r'(\d+):(\d{2})', value)` — just extract minutes

#### Updated prompt

```
3. CLOCK: What does the PRIMARY match timer show?
   Report the main clock display (e.g., "34:12", "90:00", "2H 15:30"). Copy exactly.

4. ADDED: Is there an ADDITIONAL TIME indicator (like "+3", "+5") shown near the clock?
   If yes, report exactly what you see (e.g., "+4", "+6").
   If none visible, answer NONE.

5. STOPPAGE_CLOCK: Is there a SEPARATE smaller clock counting time within added/stoppage time?
   Some broadcasts freeze the main clock (e.g., at 90:00) and show a small running
   sub-timer (e.g., "03:57") for the elapsed stoppage time.
   If you see this separate sub-timer, report it (e.g., "03:57").
   If there is no separate sub-timer, answer NONE.

Answer format (exactly):
SOCCER: YES or NO
SCREEN: YES or NO
CLOCK: <exact text from main timer> or NONE
ADDED: <exact indicator like +4> or NONE
STOPPAGE_CLOCK: <exact sub-timer text> or NONE
```

#### Updated `parse_response()` return

Currently returns 3-tuple: `(is_soccer, is_screen, raw_clock)`

**New return:** dict: `{is_soccer, is_screen, raw_clock, raw_added, raw_stoppage_clock}`

Each raw value is the string exactly as reported by the AI, or `None` if the AI said NONE or the field was missing.

### Clock parsing logic (structured extraction)

With the structured three-field prompt, parsing becomes significantly simpler. Each field is parsed independently.

#### Parsing CLOCK (primary timer)

The CLOCK field now only contains the primary match timer — no stoppage concatenations. This means **Patterns D and E are eliminated**. Only Patterns A, B, and C (as fallback) are needed.

```python
def parse_clock_field(raw_clock: str | None) -> int | None:
    """
    Parse the CLOCK field from structured extraction.
    
    Handles:
    A) Running match clock: "34:12" → 34, "84:28" → 84
    B) Period indicator + time: "2H 5:00" → 50, "ET 04:04" → 94
    C) Compact stoppage (fallback): "45+2" → 47 (if AI puts it all in CLOCK)
    
    Patterns D and E are eliminated — the structured prompt separates
    the frozen base, allocation indicator, and sub-clock into their own fields.
    """
    if not raw_clock or raw_clock.upper() in ("NONE", "HT", "FT", "HALF TIME", "FULL TIME"):
        return None
    
    text = raw_clock.upper().strip()
    
    # Detect period indicators
    has_et = bool(re.search(r'\b(ET|AET|EXTRA\s*TIME)\b', text))
    has_2h = bool(re.search(r'\b(2H|2ND\s*HALF)\b', text))
    has_1h = bool(re.search(r'\b(1H|1ST\s*HALF)\b', text))
    clean_text = re.sub(r'\b(ET|AET|EXTRA\s*TIME|2H|2ND\s*HALF|1H|1ST\s*HALF)\b', '', text).strip()

    # (in case AI dumps the combined display into CLOCK despite structured prompt)
    stoppage_match = re.match(r'(\d+)\s*\+\s*(\d+)', clean_text)
    if stoppage_match:
        return int(stoppage_match.group(1)) + int(stoppage_match.group(2))

        if just_minutes:
            minutes = int(just_minutes.group(1))
        else:

    elif has_1h:
        return minutes
    else:
        return minutes
```

#### Parsing ADDED (stoppage indicator)

```python
def parse_added_field(raw_added: str | None) -> int | None:
    """Parse the ADDED field: "+4" → 4, "+6" → 6, "NONE" → None."""
    if not raw_added or raw_added.upper().strip() == "NONE":
        return None
    match = re.search(r'\+\s*(\d+)', raw_added)
    return int(match.group(1)) if match else None
```

#### Parsing STOPPAGE_CLOCK (sub-timer)

```python
def parse_stoppage_clock_field(raw_stoppage: str | None) -> int | None:
    """Parse the STOPPAGE_CLOCK field: "03:57" → 3, "1:30" → 1, "NONE" → None."""
    if not raw_stoppage or raw_stoppage.upper().strip() == "NONE":
        return None
    match = re.match(r'(\d{1,2}):(\d{2})', raw_stoppage.strip())
    return int(match.group(1)) if match else None
```

#### Computing absolute minute

```python
def compute_absolute_minute(
    clock_minutes: int | None,
    stoppage_clock_minutes: int | None
) -> int | None:
    """
    Compute absolute match minute from structured extraction fields.
    
    Three cases:
    1. Frozen-clock stoppage (STOPPAGE_CLOCK present):
       clock_minutes + stoppage_clock_minutes
       e.g., CLOCK=90:00, STOPPAGE_CLOCK=03:57 → 90 + 3 = 93
    
    2. Running-clock stoppage (ADDED present, no STOPPAGE_CLOCK):
       clock_minutes directly (already includes stoppage)
       e.g., CLOCK=96:46, ADDED=+6 → 96
    
    3. Regular time (neither ADDED nor STOPPAGE_CLOCK):
       clock_minutes directly
       e.g., CLOCK=48:50 → 48
    
    Note: Cases 2 and 3 have the same formula — the ADDED field is only
    used for cross-checking against api_extra, not for minute computation.
    """
    if clock_minutes is None:
        return None
    if stoppage_clock_minutes is not None:
        return clock_minutes + stoppage_clock_minutes
    return clock_minutes
```

#### Backward compatibility: `parse_broadcast_clock()`

The existing `parse_broadcast_clock()` function (with all 5 patterns) is **kept as a fallback**. If the AI returns a single combined string in the CLOCK field despite the structured prompt, we can still parse it. The function remains unchanged — it just becomes the second-choice parser rather than the primary one.

### Timestamp validation logic

The API gives us two fields per event: `elapsed` (int) and `extra` (int | null).

**Regular time goals:** `elapsed` = actual minute, `extra` = null.
Example: goal at 30th minute → `{"elapsed": 30, "extra": null}`

**Stoppage time goals:** `elapsed` = period boundary (always 45, 90, 105, or 120), `extra` = minutes into stoppage.
Example: 90+3 goal → `{"elapsed": 90, "extra": 3}`

This means `elapsed + extra` = the reported minute of the goal. Since the API reports the minute AFTER the event, the broadcast clock should show approximately `elapsed + extra - 1`.

**Two-phase comparison (unchanged):**

1. **Direct match** — Does the computed absolute minute fall within ±1 of `expected`?
2. **Stoppage-time OCR correction** — Vision models sometimes drop the leading digit of the clock (reading `92:36` as `02:36`). In stoppage time, `api_elapsed` IS the dropped base (90), so we can try: `corrected = api_elapsed + parsed_minute`. The ±1 comparison naturally constrains which values can match — only parsed minutes ≈ `api_extra` (±1) will pass.

**New: ADDED cross-check (soft signal)**

The structured extraction gives us the ADDED field, which we can compare against `api_extra`:
- If AI sees ADDED (e.g., `+4`) AND `api_extra` is not null → confirms this is stoppage time. The values may differ slightly (referee can extend stoppage beyond the announced allocation).
- If AI sees ADDED but `api_extra` is null → soft warning. Could be a regular-time goal near period end where stoppage indicator is already displayed.
- If AI sees no ADDED but `api_extra` is set → soft warning. Could be running-clock broadcast that doesn't show the indicator separately.

This cross-check is **informational only** — it does NOT affect the verified/unverified outcome. The minute comparison remains the sole determinant.

**Why the OCR correction is safe:**
- Only triggers when `api_extra is not None` (confirmed stoppage time)
- The math `abs(api_elapsed + minute - expected) <= 1` simplifies to `abs(minute - api_extra + 1) <= 1`, meaning only parsed minutes in the range `[api_extra - 2, api_extra]` can match
- For `api_extra=3`: only parsed minutes 1, 2, or 3 pass
- For `api_extra=8`: only parsed minutes 6, 7, or 8 pass
- No arbitrary threshold needed — the comparison constrains naturally

    return (False, closest, "rejected")
```

### Test cases for clock parsing

#### CLOCK field parsing (parse_clock_field)

| Raw CLOCK text | Parsed minute | Category | Notes |
|----------------|---------------|----------|-------|
| `"34:12"` | 34 | A | Standard first half |
| `"84:28"` | 84 | A | Standard second half |
| `"112:54"` | 112 | A | Standard extra time |
| `"2H 5:00"` | 50 | B | 45 + 5 (relative, 5 < 45) |
| `"2H 15:30"` | 60 | B | 45 + 15 (relative, 15 < 45) |
| `"2H 67:00"` | 67 | B | Already absolute (67 >= 45, don't add) |
| `"1H 35:00"` | 35 | B | Explicit first half |
| `"ET 04:04"` | 94 | B | 90 + 4 (relative, 4 < 30) |
| `"AET 04:04"` | 94 | B | 90 + 4 (same as ET) |
| `"ET 15:00"` | 105 | B | 90 + 15 (relative, 15 < 30) |
| `"ET 102:53"` | 102 | B | Already absolute (102 >= 90, don't add) |
| `"ET 95:00"` | 95 | B | Already absolute (95 >= 90, don't add) |
| `"45+2:30"` | 47 | C (fallback) | Compact stoppage — should rarely appear with structured prompt |
| `"45+2"` | 47 | C (fallback) | Compact stoppage |
| `"90+3:15"` | 93 | C (fallback) | Compact stoppage |
| `"90+3"` | 93 | C (fallback) | Compact stoppage |
| `"105+2"` | 107 | C (fallback) | Compact ET stoppage |
| `"HT"` | None | — | Half time, no clock |
| `"FT"` | None | — | Full time, no clock |
| `None` | None | — | No clock visible |
| `"NONE"` | None | — | AI reported no clock |

#### ADDED field parsing (parse_added_field)

| Raw ADDED text | Parsed value | Notes |
|----------------|-------------|-------|
| `"+4"` | 4 | Standard |
| `"+6"` | 6 | Standard |
| `"+4'"` | 4 | With trailing apostrophe (seen in Sarr test) |
| `"+ 3"` | 3 | With space |
| `"NONE"` | None | No indicator visible |
| `None` | None | Field missing |

#### STOPPAGE_CLOCK field parsing (parse_stoppage_clock_field)

| Raw STOPPAGE_CLOCK text | Parsed minutes | Notes |
|------------------------|---------------|-------|
| `"03:57"` | 3 | Standard MM:SS |
| `"1:30"` | 1 | Single-digit minutes |
| `"00:43"` | 0 | Less than 1 minute |
| `"NONE"` | None | No sub-timer visible |
| `None` | None | Field missing |

#### Absolute minute computation (compute_absolute_minute)

| CLOCK parsed | STOPPAGE_CLOCK parsed | Absolute | Broadcast type |
|-------------|----------------------|----------|----------------|
| 48 | None | 48 | Regular time |
| 96 | None | 96 | Running-clock stoppage |
| 90 | 3 | 93 | Frozen-clock stoppage |
| 45 | 0 | 45 | Frozen-clock stoppage (just started) |
| 90 | 5 | 95 | Frozen-clock stoppage |
| None | None | None | No clock visible |

### What passes, what fails (validation)

| API time | Expected | Frame 25% | Frame 75% | Result |
|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| 45+2 | 46 | CLOCK=45:30, ADDED=+4 | CLOCK=47:12, ADDED=+4 | **PASS** (45 within ±1 of 46) |
| 95 | 94 | CLOCK=ET 04:04, ADDED=NONE | CLOCK=ET 05:30, ADDED=NONE | **PASS** (94 matches) |
| 50 | 49 | CLOCK=2H 5:00 | CLOCK=2H 6:30 | **PASS** (50 within ±1 of 49) |
| 30 | 29 | CLOCK=65:00 | CLOCK=72:00 | **FAIL** (both clocks are wrong half) |
| 30 | 29 | CLOCK=NONE | CLOCK=28:45 | **PASS** (28 within ±1 of 29) |
| 30 | 29 | CLOCK=NONE | CLOCK=NONE | **UNVERIFIED** (no clock visible) |
| 30 | 29 | CLOCK=HT | CLOCK=HT | **UNVERIFIED** (HT = no usable clock) |
| 90+4 | 93 | CLOCK=90:00, ADDED=+4, STOP=02:17 | CLOCK=NONE | **PASS** (90+2=92, within ±1 of 93) |
| 45+1 | 45 | CLOCK=45:00, ADDED=+2, STOP=00:43 | same | **PASS** (45+0=45, matches 45) |
| 0 | — | CLOCK=34:12 | CLOCK=35:30 | **UNVERIFIED** (api_elapsed=0 guard) |
| 90+3 | 92 | CLOCK=92:07, ADDED=+8 | CLOCK=02:36, ADDED=+8 | **PASS** (92:07→92; 02:36 OCR correction: 90+2=92) |
| 45+2 | 46 | CLOCK=01:15, ADDED=+3 | CLOCK=NONE | **PASS** (01:15 OCR correction: 45+1=46) |

### When no clock is visible

If neither frame has a parseable game clock, we **cannot verify** the timestamp. The video is marked `timestamp_verified: false` and kept as an **unverified** video.

**We fail open** — many valid clips crop out the scoreboard (close-up celebrations, replays, fan recordings). We don't reject them, but we keep them separate from verified clips during deduplication. Unverified videos can only dedup against other unverified videos for the same event.

### Data flow changes (ALL COMPLETE — commit `4dcf3bc`)

1. ✅ **`TwitterWorkflowInput`** — `event_minute: int = 0` and `event_extra: Optional[int] = None` added
2. ✅ **`DownloadWorkflow.run()`** — `event_minute: int = 0` and `event_extra: int | None = None` added (positional with defaults)
3. ✅ **`validate_video_is_soccer()`** — `event_minute: int = 0` and `event_extra: int = None` params added
4. ✅ **`monitor_workflow.py`** — passes `event_minute=minute, event_extra=extra` to `TwitterWorkflowInput`
5. ✅ **Vision prompt** — structured 5-field prompt (SOCCER / SCREEN / CLOCK / ADDED / STOPPAGE_CLOCK)
6. ✅ **Parse response** — returns dict: `{is_soccer, is_screen, raw_clock, raw_added, raw_stoppage_clock}`
7. ✅ **Parse clock fields** — `parse_clock_field()`, `parse_added_field()`, `parse_stoppage_clock_field()`, `compute_absolute_minute()` per frame
8. ✅ **Validate timestamp** — `validate_timestamp()` with structured frame dicts + API time
9. ✅ **Return value** — `clock_verified`, `extracted_minute`, `timestamp_status` in return dict. `is_valid` absorbs timestamp rejection.

## Phase 2: Timestamp-Scoped Deduplication

### The problem with current dedup

The current perceptual hash dedup is **event-scoped** — it only compares videos within the same `event_id`. But it has no way to distinguish a clip of the actual goal from a clip of a different moment in the same match (e.g. a 30th-minute highlight vs the 75th-minute goal we actually want). Hash similarity between two broadcast clips of the same match is high regardless of which minute they show.

### The verification model

Timestamp extraction from Phase 1 classifies each video into one of three outcomes:

| Status | Criteria | What happens |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| **Verified** | Extracted clock minute is within ±1 of expected API time `(elapsed + extra - 1)` | Kept. Deduplicated only against other verified videos. |
| **Rejected** | Extracted clock minute exists but is **outside** the ±1 range | **Discarded entirely** — this is a clip of the wrong part of the match. Never uploaded, never stored. |
| **Unverified** | No clock visible in either the 25% or 75% frame | Kept. Deduplicated only against other unverified videos. Cannot verify, but may still be valid (cropped scoreboard, close-up replays, fan recordings). |

This is a **massive improvement** over the current approach because:
1. Rejected clips (wrong minute) are discarded outright — they previously polluted dedup clusters and could replace correct clips
2. Verified and unverified videos are deduplicated independently — a verified 30th-minute clip can never match against an unverified clip that might be from minute 75
3. S3 dedup gets the same benefit — when comparing against existing S3 videos, only compare within the same verification group

### How this applies to both dedup phases

#### Batch dedup (`deduplicate_videos` Phase 1)

Currently: all downloaded videos in a single event are compared against each other using perceptual hashes. Perceptually similar videos are grouped into clusters, and the best video from each cluster survives (best = longest, or highest resolution if durations are similar). There can be many clusters — one survivor per cluster, not one overall winner.

**New behavior:**
1. Rejected videos were already discarded in the DownloadWorkflow (before reaching dedup)
2. Separate remaining videos into verified (`timestamp_verified=True`) and unverified (`timestamp_verified=False`)
3. Run perceptual hash clustering **only within verified** and **only within unverified** separately
4. A verified video is never compared against an unverified video — they can't end up in the same cluster
5. All survivors from both groups proceed to S3 dedup

#### S3 dedup (`deduplicate_videos` Phase 2)

Currently: each cluster survivor is compared against all existing S3 videos for the event using perceptual hashes.

**New behavior:**
1. Each S3 video in MongoDB has a stored `timestamp_verified` field (true, false, or absent for legacy videos)
2. Each survivor is only compared against S3 videos **in the same verification group**
3. A verified video is only compared to existing verified S3 videos
4. An unverified video is only compared to existing unverified S3 videos
5. Legacy S3 videos (no `timestamp_verified` field) are treated as unverified

This prevents the exact scenario that caused the Szoboszlai bug: a meme video (unverified or rejected) replacing a verified goal clip.

### Storage architecture

**Where things are stored:**
- **MongoDB** (`events` collection, `_s3_videos` array): All video **metadata** including `timestamp_verified`, `extracted_minute`, `perceptual_hash`, resolution, etc. This is the queryable source of truth.
- **S3** (`footy-videos` bucket): The actual video **file bytes**. Just blob storage.

The `S3Video` TypedDict (confusingly named) defines the schema for what's stored in **MongoDB**. The name is historical — it describes videos that have been uploaded to S3, but the metadata itself lives in Mongo.

### Storage rules

| Status | Stored in MongoDB? | Uploaded to S3? | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Verified** (clock matches) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Full storage, queryable |
| **Unverified** (no clock) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Full storage, queryable |
| **Rejected** (wrong clock) | ❌ No | ❌ No | Discarded — not stored anywhere |

### MongoDB schema changes

The video object stored in MongoDB `_s3_videos` array currently has:
```
{url, perceptual_hash, resolution_score, file_size, popularity, rank}
```

**Add two new fields:**
```
{
  url, perceptual_hash, resolution_score, file_size, popularity, rank,
  timestamp_verified: true | false,  // Did the extracted clock match the API time?
  extracted_minute: int | null       // The game clock minute extracted by AI (null if no clock)
}
```

These fields enable:
- **Scoped dedup**: New videos only compared against same-status videos in MongoDB
- **Analytics**: Track what % of videos have visible clocks, clock extraction accuracy

### Pipeline data flow
- `validate_video_is_soccer()` extracts structured clock data from 25% and 75% frames
  - Each frame produces: `{clock: str, added: str, stoppage_clock: str}` (raw AI output)
- Per frame: `parse_clock_field()` → clock minutes, `parse_stoppage_clock_field()` → sub-timer minutes
- `compute_absolute_minute()` combines them (frozen-clock case: base + sub-timer)
- `validate_timestamp()` checks if EITHER frame's absolute minute matches API time (only one needs to match!)
- ADDED field cross-checked against `api_extra` (informational log, doesn't affect verification)
- Returns `clock_verified: bool`, `extracted_minute: int|None`, `timestamp_status: str` ("verified", "unverified", or "rejected")
- DownloadWorkflow attaches these to `video_info` dict before passing to UploadWorkflow
- UploadWorkflow includes them in the video object saved to MongoDB

**No MongoDB schema migration needed** — existing videos without `timestamp_verified` are treated as unverified. New videos get the field assigned at validation time.

### The `video_info` dict through the pipeline

```
DownloadWorkflow
  ├── download_video()       → {file_path, file_hash, file_size, duration, ...}
  ├── validate_video()       → adds {clock_verified, extracted_minute, timestamp_verified}
  ├── generate_hash()        → adds {perceptual_hash}
  └── signal UploadWorkflow  → full video_info with all fields

UploadWorkflow
  ├── deduplicate_by_md5()   → filters exact dupes
  ├── deduplicate_videos()   → perceptual hash dedup (called TWICE in parallel: verified pool + unverified pool)
  ├── upload_single_video()  → S3 upload with metadata
  └── save_video_objects()   → MongoDB with timestamp_verified + extracted_minute
```

MD5 dedup stays unscoped because identical files are identical regardless of what minute they show.

### Fetch event data changes

`fetch_event_data()` in upload.py already loads `existing_s3_videos` from MongoDB with `perceptual_hash`. It needs to also load `timestamp_verified` and `extracted_minute` so that `deduplicate_videos()` can scope S3 comparisons.

This is already done implicitly — `fetch_event_data()` loads the full video object from `_s3_videos`, so any new fields we store will automatically be available. No code change needed here.

## Current Models & Data Flow (Comprehensive Reference)

### Model Definitions (`src/data/models.py`)

#### `APIEventTime` (TypedDict)
Source of truth for when an event happened. Comes from the API's `event.time` object.
```python
class APIEventTime(TypedDict, total=False):
    elapsed: Optional[int]   # Base minute (e.g. 45)
    extra: Optional[int]     # Added time (e.g. 2 for 45+2)
```
**No changes needed** — this is the API input we compare against.

#### `EventFields` (Constants class)
String constants for all underscore-prefixed enhanced fields on events. Prevents typos.
```python
class EventFields:
    EVENT_ID = "_event_id"
    MONITOR_WORKFLOWS = "_monitor_workflows"
    MONITOR_COMPLETE = "_monitor_complete"
    FIRST_SEEN = "_first_seen"
    DOWNLOAD_WORKFLOWS = "_download_workflows"
    DOWNLOAD_COMPLETE = "_download_complete"
    DOWNLOAD_COMPLETED_AT = "_download_completed_at"
    TWITTER_SEARCH = "_twitter_search"
    TWITTER_ALIASES = "_twitter_aliases"
    DROP_WORKFLOWS = "_drop_workflows"
    DISCOVERED_VIDEOS = "_discovered_videos"
    S3_VIDEOS = "_s3_videos"
    VIDEO_COUNT = "_video_count"
    DOWNLOAD_STATS = "_download_stats"
    SCORE_AFTER = "_score_after"
    SCORING_TEAM = "_scoring_team"
    REMOVED = "_removed"
    # DEPRECATED
    MONITOR_COUNT = "_monitor_count"
    TWITTER_COUNT = "_twitter_count"
```
**No changes needed** — event-level fields don't change. Videos within `_s3_videos` get new fields, but those are defined in `VideoFields` / `S3Video`.

#### `VideoFields` (Constants class)
String constants for fields on video objects within `_s3_videos`. Currently only covers 6 of the 13+ actual fields:
```python
class VideoFields:
    URL = "url"
    PERCEPTUAL_HASH = "perceptual_hash"
    RESOLUTION_SCORE = "resolution_score"
    FILE_SIZE = "file_size"
    POPULARITY = "popularity"
    RANK = "rank"
```
**⚠️ Gap:** The `S3Video` TypedDict has `width`, `height`, `aspect_ratio`, `bitrate`, `duration`, `source_url`, `hash_version`, `_s3_key` — none of these have `VideoFields` constants. This is a pre-existing gap, not caused by this refactor.

**Changes needed:**
```python
class VideoFields:
    # ... existing fields ...
    # NEW: Timestamp verification fields
    TIMESTAMP_VERIFIED = "timestamp_verified"
    EXTRACTED_MINUTE = "extracted_minute"
```

#### `S3Video` (TypedDict)
Full schema for video objects stored in MongoDB's `_s3_videos` array. This is the source of truth — S3 metadata may be truncated.
```python
class S3Video(TypedDict, total=False):
    url: str                  # Relative URL: /video/footy-videos/{key}
    _s3_key: str              # S3 key for direct operations
    perceptual_hash: str      # Hash for deduplication
    resolution_score: float
    file_size: int            # File size in bytes
    popularity: int           # Times this clip was found (default: 1)
    rank: int                 # 1=best, higher=worse
    # Quality metadata
    width: int
    height: int
    aspect_ratio: float
    bitrate: int
    duration: float
    source_url: str           # Original tweet URL
    hash_version: str         # Version of hash algorithm used
```
**Changes needed:**
```python
class S3Video(TypedDict, total=False):
    # ... all existing fields ...
    # NEW: Timestamp verification fields
    timestamp_verified: bool      # True if clock matched API time, False if no clock visible (rejected videos are never stored)
    extracted_minute: Optional[int]  # Game clock minute extracted by AI (None if not visible)
```

#### `DownloadStats` (TypedDict)
Pipeline stage counters stored in `_download_stats` on events. Tracks what happened to each video.
```python
class DownloadStats(TypedDict, total=False):
    discovered: int               # Total discovered from Twitter
    downloaded: int               # Successfully downloaded
    filtered_aspect_duration: int # Filtered by aspect/duration
    download_failed: int          # Failed to download
    md5_deduped: int              # Removed by MD5 dedup
    md5_s3_matched: int           # MD5 matched existing S3
    ai_rejected: int              # Not soccer
    ai_validation_failed: int     # AI timeout/error
    hash_generated: int           # Hash generated ok
    hash_failed: int              # Hash failed
    perceptual_deduped: int       # Perceptual dedup removed
    s3_replaced: int              # Replaced lower quality S3
    s3_popularity_bumped: int     # Existing S3 kept, popularity bumped
    uploaded: int                 # Successfully uploaded
```
**Changes needed:**
```python
class DownloadStats(TypedDict, total=False):
    # ... all existing fields ...
    # NEW: Timestamp rejection tracking
    timestamp_rejected: int       # Clock visible but wrong minute — video discarded
```

#### `DiscoveredVideo` (TypedDict)
Raw video metadata from Twitter scraper. Stored in `_discovered_videos`.
```python
class DiscoveredVideo(TypedDict, total=False):
    video_page_url: str
    video_url: str
    tweet_url: str
    tweet_text: str
    username: str
    views: int
    likes: int
    retweets: int
```
**No changes needed** — these are pre-download, timestamp extraction happens during validation.

#### `EnhancedEvent` (TypedDict)
Full event structure with all tracking fields. Contains `_s3_videos: List[S3Video]`.
**No direct changes needed** — inherits S3Video changes automatically.

### Workflow Input Types

#### `TwitterWorkflowInput` (dataclass) — `src/workflows/twitter_workflow.py:65`
```python
@dataclass
class TwitterWorkflowInput:
    fixture_id: int
    event_id: str
    team_id: int                    # API-Football team ID
    team_name: str                  # "Liverpool"
    player_name: Optional[str]      # Can be None
```
**Changes needed:**
```python
@dataclass
class TwitterWorkflowInput:
    fixture_id: int
    event_id: str
    team_id: int
    team_name: str
    player_name: Optional[str]
    # NEW: Event minute for timestamp verification
    event_minute: int = 0                    # API elapsed minute
    event_extra: Optional[int] = None        # API extra time (45+2 → extra=2)
```
Fields are appended with defaults so existing Temporal workflow histories remain compatible.

#### `DownloadWorkflow.run()` — `src/workflows/download_workflow.py:71`
Currently takes positional args (not a dataclass):
```python
async def run(self, fixture_id: int, event_id: str, player_name: str,
              team_name: str, discovered_videos: list) -> dict:
```
**Changes needed:**
```python
async def run(self, fixture_id: int, event_id: str, player_name: str,
              team_name: str, discovered_videos: list,
              event_minute: int = 0, event_extra: int = None) -> dict:
```
Appended with defaults for Temporal replay compatibility.

### Activity Signatures

#### `validate_video_is_soccer()` — `src/activities/download.py:434`
```python
async def validate_video_is_soccer(file_path: str, event_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
```
**Changes needed:**
```python
async def validate_video_is_soccer(
    file_path: str, event_id: str,
    event_minute: int = 0, event_extra: int = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
```
Return value currently:
```python
{
    "is_valid": bool,
    "confidence": float,
    "reason": str,
    "is_soccer": bool,
    "is_screen_recording": bool,
    "detected_features": list,
    "checks_performed": int,
}
```
**New return value:**
```python
{
    "is_valid": bool,              # soccer AND not screen AND timestamp not rejected
    "confidence": float,
    "reason": str,                 # includes timestamp rejection reason if applicable
    "is_soccer": bool,
    "is_screen_recording": bool,
    "detected_features": list,
    "checks_performed": int,
    # NEW: Structured clock extraction
    "clock_verified": bool,            # True if extracted clock matches API time ±1
    "extracted_minute": int | None,     # Best extracted clock minute (None if no clock)
    "timestamp_status": str,           # "verified" / "unverified" / "rejected"
    "extracted_clocks": list[dict],    # Raw structured data per frame:
                                       #   [{clock, added, stoppage_clock}, ...]
}
```
Note: `is_valid` now incorporates timestamp rejection. `timestamp_status` is still returned separately for logging/analytics but DownloadWorkflow only needs to check `is_valid`.

#### `upload_single_video()` — `src/activities/upload.py:700`
```python
async def upload_single_video(
    file_path, fixture_id, event_id, player_name, team_name,
    video_index, file_hash, perceptual_hash, duration, popularity,
    assister_name, opponent_team, source_url,
    width, height, bitrate, file_size, existing_s3_key
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
```
Returns a `video_object` dict that goes into MongoDB:
```python
"video_object": {
    "url", "_s3_key", "perceptual_hash", "resolution_score",
    "file_size", "popularity", "rank",
    "width", "height", "aspect_ratio", "bitrate",
    "duration", "source_url", "hash_version",
}
```
**Changes needed:** Add `timestamp_verified` and `extracted_minute` params, include in `video_object`:
```python
async def upload_single_video(
    ...,
    existing_s3_key: str = "",
    # NEW
    timestamp_verified: bool = False,
    extracted_minute: int = None,
) -> Dict[str, Any]:

# In video_object:
"video_object": {
    # ... all existing fields ...
    "timestamp_verified": timestamp_verified,
    "extracted_minute": extracted_minute,
}
```

#### `deduplicate_videos()` — `src/activities/upload.py:425`
```python
async def deduplicate_videos(
    downloaded_files: List[Dict[str, Any]],
    existing_s3_videos: Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]] = None,
    event_id: str = "",
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
```
**Signature stays the same. Internal logic stays the same.** The function doesn't need to know about verification status at all. Scoping is done at the workflow level — `upload_workflow.py` splits videos into verified/unverified pools and calls `deduplicate_videos()` twice in parallel (via `asyncio.gather()`), each time with a different subset. See Task 11+12 details in Phase 2 section.

### The `video_info` dict lifecycle

The `video_info` dict is a plain dict (not a TypedDict) that accumulates fields as it moves through the DownloadWorkflow pipeline. Here's every field at each stage:

**After download_single_video():**
```python
{
    "status": "success",
    "file_path": "/tmp/found-footy/{event_id}_{run_id}/video_0.mp4",
    "file_hash": "abc123...",       # MD5 hash
    "file_size": 2500000,
    "duration": 45.2,
    "width": 1280,
    "height": 720,
    "bitrate": 3500000,
    "source_url": "https://twitter.com/...",
}
```

**After validate_video_is_soccer() — NEW fields attached:**
```python
{
    # ... all download fields ...
    "clock_verified": True,          # ◄── NEW
    "extracted_minute": 46,          # ◄── NEW (None if no clock)
    "timestamp_verified": True,      # ◄── NEW (True if clock matched, False if no clock)
}
```
Rejected videos (clock visible but wrong minute) are DISCARDED at this stage — they never reach dedup or upload.

**After generate_video_hash():**
```python
{
    # ... all above fields ...
    "perceptual_hash": "dense:0.25:a1b2c3...",
}
```

**After batch MD5 dedup (within DownloadWorkflow):**
```python
{
    # ... all above fields ...
    "popularity": 2,                 # Bumped if MD5 duplicates found
}
```

**Sent to UploadWorkflow via signal — all fields above are preserved.**

**After upload_single_video() → video_object for MongoDB:**
```python
{
    "url": "/video/footy-videos/...",
    "_s3_key": "footy-videos/...",
    "perceptual_hash": "dense:0.25:a1b2c3...",
    "resolution_score": 921600,
    "file_size": 2500000,
    "popularity": 2,
    "rank": 0,
    "width": 1280,
    "height": 720,
    "aspect_ratio": 1.78,
    "bitrate": 3500000,
    "duration": 45.2,
    "source_url": "https://twitter.com/...",
    "hash_version": "dense:0.25",
    "timestamp_verified": True,      # ◄── NEW
    "extracted_minute": 46,          # ◄── NEW
}
```

### Call Sites (ALL UPDATED — commit `4dcf3bc`)

| Location | Change Made |
|----------|-------------|
| `monitor_workflow.py` | `TwitterWorkflowInput(... event_minute=minute, event_extra=extra)` |
| `twitter_workflow.py` | DownloadWorkflow args include `input.event_minute, input.event_extra` |
| `download_workflow.py` | `validate_video_is_soccer` args include `event_minute, event_extra`; attaches `clock_verified`, `extracted_minute`, `timestamp_verified` to `video_info`; counts `timestamp_rejected` |
| `upload_workflow.py` | `upload_single_video` args include `timestamp_verified, extracted_minute` |

### Backward Compatibility

1. **Temporal replay safety:** All new params use defaults (`event_minute=0`, `event_extra=None`, `timestamp_verified=False`, `extracted_minute=None`). In-flight workflows replay cleanly — they're treated as unverified (no clock info), matching current behavior.

2. **MongoDB migration:** None needed. Existing `_s3_videos` documents without `timestamp_verified` are treated as unverified. The `total=False` on `S3Video` TypedDict means all fields are optional. `fetch_event_data()` loads full video objects, so new fields are automatically available when present.

3. **DownloadStats:** Existing stats objects without `timestamp_rejected` are valid — `TypedDict(total=False)` makes it optional.

## Pre-Implementation Review (2026-02-15)

Code review of the plan against the actual codebase. Updated 2026-02-15 after discussion.

### 1. `parse_response()` returns dict ✅ RESOLVED

`parse_response()` (nested inside `validate_video_is_soccer()`) returns a dict with named keys, matching the pattern used in `scripts/test_structured_extraction.py`:

```python
def parse_response(resp) -> dict:
    """Parse vision model response into structured dict."""
    return {
        "is_soccer": bool,
        "is_screen": bool,
        "raw_clock": str | None,
        "raw_added": str | None,
        "raw_stoppage_clock": str | None,
    }
```

This is a local change — `parse_response()` is a nested function, not exported. The existing soccer/screen tiebreaker logic indexes by key instead of position. All downstream code updated to match.

### 2. Tiebreaker (50%) frame: extract but don't use for validation ✅ RESOLVED

The 50% tiebreaker frame is only extracted when 25% and 75% disagree on soccer/screen detection. Clock data IS extracted from it (because CLOCK/ADDED/STOPPAGE_CLOCK are part of the prompt) but it is **not passed to `validate_timestamp()`**. Only the 25% and 75% frames are used for timestamp validation because:

- The 50% frame doesn't run every time — validation can't depend on it
- Its timestamp is almost certainly between the 25% and 75% values, adding no new signal
- If both 25% and 75% fail timestamp validation, a middle frame won't help

The prompt stays consistent across all frames (no prompt variant without clock questions), keeping the AI querying logic uniform.

### 3. `is_valid` absorbs timestamp rejection ⚠️ DESIGN DECISION

**Current `is_valid`:** `is_soccer AND NOT is_screen`

**Proposed change:** Fold timestamp rejection into `is_valid` at the AI validation layer:

```python
is_valid = is_soccer and not is_screen_recording and (timestamp_status != "rejected")
```

This means:
- `is_valid=True` → video is soccer, not a screen recording, AND clock either matches or isn't visible
- `is_valid=False` → rejected for any reason (not soccer, screen recording, OR wrong game minute)

**Advantage:** DownloadWorkflow stays simple — one `if validation.get("is_valid")` check, no second rejection branch. The `reason` field already explains WHY a video was rejected ("not soccer", "screen recording", "wrong game minute: expected 46, got 72").

**The `timestamp_status` field still exists** for logging and analytics. It's returned alongside `is_valid` so we can track rejection reasons in `download_stats`, but DownloadWorkflow doesn't need to check it separately.

**Impact on DownloadWorkflow:**
```python
# NO CHANGE to the existing check:
if validation.get("is_valid", True):
    # Attach verification fields
    video_info["clock_verified"] = validation.get("clock_verified", False)
    video_info["extracted_minute"] = validation.get("extracted_minute")
    video_info["timestamp_verified"] = validation.get("timestamp_status") == "verified"
    validated_videos.append(video_info)
else:
    rejected_count += 1
    # reason already explains why (not soccer / screen / wrong minute)
    log.info(workflow.logger, MODULE, "video_rejected",
             "Video filtered by AI validation",
             reason=validation.get('reason', 'unknown'),
             timestamp_status=validation.get('timestamp_status'),
             ...)
```

**Tracking timestamp rejections separately:** We still need `timestamp_rejected` in `download_stats` for visibility. `validate_video_is_soccer()` returns `timestamp_status` in the dict, so DownloadWorkflow can count it even though `is_valid` already handles the rejection:

```python
if not validation.get("is_valid", True):
    rejected_count += 1
    if validation.get("timestamp_status") == "rejected":
        timestamp_rejected_count += 1
    ...
```

### 4. No string-based field lookups — use model constants ✅ RESOLVED

Every MongoDB field name must be referenced through model constants (`VideoFields`, `EventFields`, etc.), never as raw strings. The existing `VideoFields` class is incomplete — it only has 6 of the 15+ fields in `S3Video`. This refactor will fix the whole class.

**Current `VideoFields` (incomplete):**
```python
class VideoFields:
    URL = "url"
    PERCEPTUAL_HASH = "perceptual_hash"
    RESOLUTION_SCORE = "resolution_score"
    FILE_SIZE = "file_size"
    POPULARITY = "popularity"
    RANK = "rank"
```

**Updated `VideoFields` (complete):**
```python
class VideoFields:
    """Constants for video object fields in _s3_videos."""
    # Existing fields
    URL = "url"
    S3_KEY = "_s3_key"
    PERCEPTUAL_HASH = "perceptual_hash"
    RESOLUTION_SCORE = "resolution_score"
    FILE_SIZE = "file_size"
    POPULARITY = "popularity"
    RANK = "rank"
    # Quality metadata
    WIDTH = "width"
    HEIGHT = "height"
    ASPECT_RATIO = "aspect_ratio"
    BITRATE = "bitrate"
    DURATION = "duration"
    SOURCE_URL = "source_url"
    HASH_VERSION = "hash_version"
    # NEW: Timestamp verification
    TIMESTAMP_VERIFIED = "timestamp_verified"
    EXTRACTED_MINUTE = "extracted_minute"
```

This applies to all video field access in `upload.py`, `upload_workflow.py`, and `download_workflow.py`. The `S3Video` TypedDict documents the schema; `VideoFields` provides the lookup constants.

**Also applies to `video_info` dict fields** added by DownloadWorkflow (e.g., `video_info[VideoFields.TIMESTAMP_VERIFIED]`). Even though `video_info` is a plain dict (not typed), using constants prevents typos in string keys.

### 5. Validation placement ✅ RESOLVED

Timestamp rejection is handled inside `validate_video_is_soccer()` itself (per item #3 above). The function already determines `is_valid` — timestamp status is just another factor in that determination. No separate check needed in DownloadWorkflow.

### 6. Internal flow through `validate_video_is_soccer()` ✅ RESOLVED

```

```

### 7. `fetch_event_data()` must pass through new fields ⚠️ NEW FINDING

**Issue:** `fetch_event_data()` in [upload.py:163-193](src/activities/upload.py#L163-L193) manually picks fields from MongoDB documents into a new `video_info` dict. It does NOT pass through all fields — only explicitly listed ones:

```python
# Current code — only these fields are extracted:
video_info = {
    "s3_url": ..., "_s3_key": ..., "perceptual_hash": ...,
    "width": ..., "height": ..., "bitrate": ..., "file_size": ...,
    "source_url": ..., "duration": ..., "resolution_score": ...,
    "popularity": ...,
}
```

**If we don't add `timestamp_verified` and `extracted_minute` here, S3 dedup scoping (Phase 2) will not work** — existing S3 videos would appear to have no verification status.

**Fix:** Add the new fields to the cherry-pick list:
```python
video_info = {
    # ... existing fields ...
    VideoFields.TIMESTAMP_VERIFIED: video_obj.get(VideoFields.TIMESTAMP_VERIFIED, False),
    VideoFields.EXTRACTED_MINUTE: video_obj.get(VideoFields.EXTRACTED_MINUTE),
}
```

Legacy videos (no `timestamp_verified` field) default to `False` (unverified), which is correct.

### 8. `upload_single_video()` positional args are fragile ⚠️ NEW FINDING

**Issue:** `upload_single_video()` takes **18 positional parameters**, and the call site in [upload_workflow.py:430-449](src/workflows/upload_workflow.py#L430-L449) passes them all as a positional `args=[]` list. Adding two more (`timestamp_verified`, `extracted_minute`) makes this 20 positional params, which is brittle and error-prone.

**This is a pre-existing problem**, not caused by this refactor. But we're making it worse. Consider:

```python
# Current call site (upload_workflow.py:430-449):
args=[
    video_info["file_path"],      # 0
    fixture_id,                    # 1
    event_id,                      # 2
    player_name,                   # 3
    team_name,                     # 4
    idx,                           # 5
    video_info.get("file_hash"),   # 6
    video_info.get("perceptual_hash"),  # 7
    video_info.get("duration"),    # 8
    video_info.get("popularity"),  # 9
    "",                            # 10 assister_name
    "",                            # 11 opponent_team
    video_info.get("source_url"),  # 12
    video_info.get("width"),       # 13
    video_info.get("height"),      # 14
    video_info.get("bitrate"),     # 15
    video_info.get("file_size"),   # 16
    existing_s3_key,               # 17
    # NEW:
    video_info.get("timestamp_verified", False),  # 18
    video_info.get("extracted_minute"),            # 19
]
```

**Resolution for now:** Append with defaults. The signature has `timestamp_verified: bool = False, extracted_minute: int = None` at the end, so Temporal replay safety is preserved. A wider refactor to use dataclasses/kwargs is out of scope but should be tracked.

### Batch test validation (2026-02-15)

The structured extraction prompt and parsing logic were validated on 10 real production goals via `scripts/test_structured_extraction.py`:

| Goal | API Time | Clock Type | Result |
|------|----------|------------|--------|
| Williams (Bilbao) | 90+6 | Running (95:24) | ✅ Verified |
| Moreira (Porto) | 90+4 | Frozen (90:00 + sub 3:11) | ✅ Verified |
| Havertz (Arsenal) | 90+7 | Running (96:46) | ✅ Verified |
| Hofmann (Gladbach) | 90+2 | Frozen (90:00 + sub 1:39) | ✅ Verified |
| Alvarez (Man City) | 45+2 | No clock (celebration) | ⚪ Unverified |
| Griezmann (Atletico) | 14' | Regular (13:52) | ✅ Verified |
| Garcia (Girona) | 6' | Regular (05:27) | ✅ Verified |
| Lookman (Atalanta) | 33' | Regular (32:18) | ✅ Verified |
| Turrientes (Real Sociedad) | 62' | Regular (61:30) | ✅ Verified |
| Baturina (Dinamo Zagreb) | 39' | Regular (38:44) | ✅ Verified |

**9/9 visible clocks verified correctly. 1/1 no-clock correctly marked unverified. 0 false positives. 0 false negatives.**

## Implementation Order

### Phase 1: AI Clock Extraction (COMPLETE — deployed 2026-02-16)

| # | Task | Status | Commit / Notes |
|---|------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Create branch `refactor/valid-deduplication` | ✅ Done | |
| 2 | Add `event_minute` + `event_extra` to workflow inputs | ✅ Done | `TwitterWorkflowInput` dataclass + `DownloadWorkflow.run()` positional args with defaults |
| 3 | Update vision prompt to structured 5-field extraction | ✅ Done | SOCCER / SCREEN / CLOCK / ADDED / STOPPAGE_CLOCK |
| 4 | Update `parse_response()` to return dict | ✅ Done | Returns `{is_soccer, is_screen, raw_clock, raw_added, raw_stoppage_clock}` |
| 5 | Add structured parsing functions | ✅ Done | `parse_clock_field()`, `parse_added_field()`, `parse_stoppage_clock_field()`, `compute_absolute_minute()` |
| 6 | Update `validate_timestamp()` for structured input | ✅ Done | Accepts `list[dict]` with raw field keys, returns `(bool, int\|None, str)` |
| 7 | Wire `event_minute`/`event_extra` through call sites | ✅ Done | monitor → twitter → download → validate, all with defaults |
| 8 | Add timestamp validation to `validate_video_is_soccer()` | ✅ Done | Calls `validate_timestamp()`, folds rejection into `is_valid` |
| 9 | Attach verification fields to `video_info` in DownloadWorkflow | ✅ Done | `clock_verified`, `extracted_minute`, `timestamp_verified` on each video_info |
| 10 | ~~Add rejected video discard in DownloadWorkflow~~ | ✅ Absorbed | Handled by `is_valid` inside `validate_video_is_soccer()` |

### Phase 2: Verification-Scoped Deduplication (IN PROGRESS)

Phase 2 scopes deduplication by verification status — verified videos only compared against verified, unverified only against unverified. This prevents a verified goal clip from being replaced by an unverified clip of a different match moment.

**Prerequisites:** Phase 1 must be live and producing reliable `timestamp_verified` values. ✅ Validated 2026-02-16 (6 verified correct, 2 unverified correct, 0 false rejections).

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 11 | Split + parallel dedup at workflow level | ✅ Done | `upload_workflow.py` — split by `timestamp_verified`, `asyncio.gather()` two `deduplicate_videos` calls |
| 12 | Merge parallel dedup results | ✅ Done | Concatenate `videos_to_upload`, `videos_to_replace`, `videos_to_bump_popularity`, `skipped_urls` |
| 13 | Rank verified videos above unverified | ✅ Done | `mongo_store.py` — `(timestamp_verified, popularity, file_size)` sort key |
| 14 | Add integration tests for scoped dedup | ⬜ TODO | Test verified-vs-verified and unverified-vs-unverified clustering |
| 15 | Test with live data | ⬜ TODO | Verify dedup + ranking decisions match expectations |
| 16 | Deploy and monitor | ⬜ TODO | Track verified/unverified distribution, check frontend ranking |

**Note:** Tasks 12-14 from the old plan (upload_single_video params, upload_workflow passthrough, download_stats tracking) were completed as part of Phase 1 since they were needed to get verification data flowing.

#### Key design decision: split at workflow level, not inside the activity

The original plan modified the internals of `deduplicate_videos()` to split/cluster/merge within one activity call. The new approach is better: **split at the workflow level** in `upload_workflow.py` and call `deduplicate_videos()` twice in parallel via `asyncio.gather()`.

**Why this is better:**
1. **Real parallelism** — Temporal activities genuinely run on separate threads. Two independent pools with no shared state = free speedup.
2. **Zero activity changes** — `deduplicate_videos()` already takes a list of videos and a list of S3 videos, clusters them, and returns results. It doesn't need to know about verification status at all. The scoping is purely about what you feed it.
3. **Same pattern already used** — the workflow already uses `asyncio.gather()` for parallel uploads (line ~465), parallel popularity bumps (line ~397), and parallel hash generation (download_workflow.py line ~393). This is the established pattern.
4. **Simpler to reason about** — each dedup call is a standalone operation on a standalone pool. No interleaving of verified/unverified logic inside a single function.

**What stays the same:**
- `deduplicate_videos()` activity code — completely unchanged
- `deduplicate_by_md5()` activity code — stays verification-agnostic (identical files are identical regardless of timestamp)
- `fetch_event_data()` — already cherry-picks `timestamp_verified` from MongoDB (added in Phase 1, commit `4dcf3bc`)
- All helper functions (`_perceptual_hashes_match`, `_pick_best_video_from_cluster`, `_should_replace_s3_video`, `_dense_hashes_match`)

#### Task 11+12: Split dedup at workflow level — implementation details

**File:** `src/workflows/upload_workflow.py`, inside `_process_batch()`, Step 3 (lines ~320-365)

##### What the current code does (line by line)

The current Step 3 in `_process_batch()` at [upload_workflow.py](src/workflows/upload_workflow.py#L320-L365):

```python
# Lines 320-330: Separate MD5 replacements from perceptual dedup candidates
md5_replacement_videos = []
perceptual_dedup_videos = []
for video in videos_after_md5:
    if video.get("_is_md5_replacement"):
        md5_replacement_videos.append({
            "new_video": video,
            "old_s3_video": video.get("_old_s3_video", {}),
        })
    else:
        perceptual_dedup_videos.append(video)

# Lines 336-340: Single call to deduplicate_videos with ALL videos + ALL S3
dedup_result = await workflow.execute_activity(
    upload_activities.deduplicate_videos,
    args=[perceptual_dedup_videos, existing_s3_videos, event_id],
    heartbeat_timeout=timedelta(seconds=120),
    start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(hours=1),
    retry_policy=RetryPolicy(maximum_attempts=3),
)

# Lines 356-363: Merge results
videos_to_upload = dedup_result.get("videos_to_upload", [])
videos_to_replace = dedup_result.get("videos_to_replace", []) + md5_replacement_videos
videos_to_bump_popularity = dedup_result.get("videos_to_bump_popularity", [])
skipped_urls = dedup_result.get("skipped_urls", [])
```

##### What the new code does

Replace the single `deduplicate_videos` call with a split → parallel calls → merge:

```python
# Lines 320-330: UNCHANGED — separate MD5 replacements from perceptual dedup candidates
md5_replacement_videos = []
perceptual_dedup_videos = []
for video in videos_after_md5:
    if video.get("_is_md5_replacement"):
        md5_replacement_videos.append({
            "new_video": video,
            "old_s3_video": video.get("_old_s3_video", {}),
        })

##### Empty pool handling — important detail

When one pool is empty (e.g., batch has 3 verified videos and 0 unverified), we should NOT call `deduplicate_videos()` with an empty list. The activity would still run (Temporal schedules it, heartbeats, etc.) and log confusing "0 videos" messages.

**Two approaches:**
1. **Inline empty result** — create a dummy coroutine that returns the empty result dict (shown in pseudocode above). This avoids calling the activity at all.
2. **Just call it** — `deduplicate_videos()` already handles empty inputs gracefully (lines 460-462: `if not successful: return {empty}`). The overhead is one unnecessary activity invocation (~30ms Temporal scheduling + activity start).

**Recommendation:** Approach 2 (just call it). Simpler code, no weird coroutine construction, and the activity already handles it. The 30ms overhead is negligible. The pseudocode above shows approach 1 for illustration but implementation should use approach 2:

```python
# SIMPLER — always call both, let the activity handle empty inputs
verified_result, unverified_result = await asyncio.gather(
    workflow.execute_activity(
        upload_activities.deduplicate_videos,
        args=[verified_videos, verified_s3, event_id],
        heartbeat_timeout=timedelta(seconds=120),
        start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(hours=1),
        retry_policy=RetryPolicy(maximum_attempts=3),
    ),
    workflow.execute_activity(
        upload_activities.deduplicate_videos,
        args=[unverified_videos, unverified_s3, event_id],
        heartbeat_timeout=timedelta(seconds=120),
        start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(hours=1),
        retry_policy=RetryPolicy(maximum_attempts=3),
    ),
)
```

##### Error handling — what happens if ONE pool fails?

Currently, if `deduplicate_videos` fails, Step 3 catches the exception and returns an empty result to **skip the entire batch** (lines 346-355):

```python
except Exception as e:
    log.error(...)
    dedup_result = {
        "videos_to_upload": [],      # EMPTY — don't upload anything!
        "videos_to_replace": [],
        "videos_to_bump_popularity": [],
        "skipped_urls": [v.get("source_url", "") for v in perceptual_dedup_videos],
    }
```

With `asyncio.gather()`, if EITHER dedup call raises, `gather` propagates the exception and we want the same behavior — skip the entire batch. The existing `try/except` around the entire block still works because `asyncio.gather()` raises the first exception from any task.

**But there's a subtlety:** if verified dedup succeeds and unverified fails (or vice versa), `gather` cancels the other task and raises. We lose the successful result too. This is actually the **correct** behavior — partial dedup could lead to inconsistent state (e.g., uploading verified videos but not their unverified counterparts from the same batch, breaking popularity accounting).

If we wanted to handle them independently (succeed on one pool even if the other fails), we'd use `asyncio.gather(return_exceptions=True)` and check each result. But that adds complexity for a rare edge case, and the current "skip batch on failure" approach is deliberately conservative. **Keep the existing behavior: if either fails, skip the whole batch.**

##### Temporal replay safety

`asyncio.gather()` on two `workflow.execute_activity()` calls is replay-safe in Temporal. Temporal records each activity invocation as a separate event in the workflow history. On replay, both activities are replayed from history in the same order. The `gather` just means they're scheduled concurrently (both start without waiting for the other).

This is identical to how parallel uploads are already done at [upload_workflow.py line ~465](src/workflows/upload_workflow.py#L465):
```python
upload_tasks = [upload_video(idx, video_info) for idx, video_info in enumerate(all_uploads)]
upload_outcomes = await asyncio.gather(*upload_tasks)
```

##### What each `video_info` dict looks like when it enters the split

By the time videos reach Step 3 (perceptual dedup), each `video_info` dict has these fields:

```python
{
    # From download_single_video() in DownloadWorkflow:
    "status": "success",
    "file_path": "/tmp/found-footy/{event_id}_{run_id}/video_0.mp4",
    "file_hash": "abc123...",       # MD5
    "file_size": 2500000,
    "duration": 45.2,
    "width": 1280,
    "height": 720,
    "bitrate": 3500000,
    "source_url": "https://twitter.com/...",

    # From validate_video_is_soccer() in DownloadWorkflow Step 3:
    "clock_verified": True,                    # ← used for logging
    "extracted_minute": 46,                    # ← stored in MongoDB
    "timestamp_verified": True,                # ← THIS IS THE SPLIT KEY
    "timestamp_status": "verified",            # ← stored in MongoDB

    # From generate_video_hash() in DownloadWorkflow Step 4:
    "perceptual_hash": "dense:0.25:0.25=a1b2c3,...",

    # From MD5 batch dedup in UploadWorkflow Step 2:
    "popularity": 2,                           # accumulated from MD5 dupes
}
```

The split key is `timestamp_verified` (bool). It was set in DownloadWorkflow at [download_workflow.py line ~317](src/workflows/download_workflow.py#L317):
```python
video_info["timestamp_verified"] = validation.get("timestamp_status") == "verified"
```

##### What each existing S3 video dict looks like

Existing S3 videos come from `fetch_event_data()` at [upload.py lines ~183-199](src/activities/upload.py#L183-L199). Each dict has:

```python
{
    "s3_url": "/video/footy-videos/...",
    "_s3_key": "footy-videos/...",
    "perceptual_hash": "dense:0.25:...",
    "width": 1280,
    "height": 720,
    "bitrate": 3500000,
    "file_size": 2500000,
    "source_url": "https://twitter.com/...",
    "duration": 45.2,
    "resolution_score": 921600,
    "popularity": 3,

    # Phase 1 fields (added in commit 4dcf3bc):
    "timestamp_verified": True,                # ← THE SPLIT KEY (defaults to False for legacy)
    "extracted_minute": 46,                    # ← None for legacy
    "timestamp_status": "verified",            # ← "unverified" for legacy
}
```

These fields were added to the cherry-pick list in `fetch_event_data()` at [upload.py lines ~195-197](src/activities/upload.py#L195-L197):
```python
"timestamp_verified": video_obj.get("timestamp_verified", False),
"extracted_minute": video_obj.get("extracted_minute"),
"timestamp_status": video_obj.get("timestamp_status", "unverified"),
```

Legacy S3 videos (uploaded before Phase 1) don't have these fields in MongoDB, so they default to `False`/`None`/`"unverified"` — they land in the unverified pool. This is intentionally correct: we can't verify them, so they should compete against other unverified videos.

##### Concurrency model — why this is safe

The upload workflow serialization guarantees that the parallel dedup cannot race with itself:

```
TwitterWorkflow starts 10 DownloadWorkflows (parallel)
    │
    ├── DownloadWF-1 finishes first → signals UploadWF
    ├── DownloadWF-5 finishes second → signals UploadWF
    ├── DownloadWF-3 finishes third → signals UploadWF
    └── ... (7 more, in whatever order they finish)

UploadWorkflow (ONE per event, ID: upload-{event_id})
    │
    ├── Process batch from DL-1 SERIALLY:
    │   ├── Fetch fresh S3 state
    │   ├── MD5 dedup
    │   ├── Split by timestamp_verified
    │   ├── asyncio.gather(                         ← PARALLEL within batch
    │   │       dedup(verified_new, verified_s3),
    │   │       dedup(unverified_new, unverified_s3),
    │   │   )
    │   ├── Merge results
    │   ├── Upload to S3
    │   └── Save to MongoDB
    │
    ├── Process batch from DL-5 SERIALLY:           ← SERIAL between batches
    │   ├── Fetch fresh S3 state (sees DL-1's uploads!)
    │   ├── ... same steps ...
    │
    └── Process batch from DL-3 SERIALLY:
        ├── Fetch fresh S3 state (sees DL-1 + DL-5's uploads!)
        └── ... same steps ...
```

The two `deduplicate_videos()` calls within a batch run in parallel, but they operate on completely disjoint sets:
- **Verified pool:** verified new videos + verified S3 videos
- **Unverified pool:** unverified new videos + unverified S3 videos

No video appears in both pools (the split is by `timestamp_verified`, which is a bool with no ambiguity). No shared mutable state. No cross-pool references. This is embarrassingly parallel.

Between batches, the workflow re-fetches S3 state (Step 1), which sees all uploads from previous batches. So batch 2's verified pool includes S3 videos uploaded by batch 1's verified pool. This is the same serialization guarantee that exists today.

##### What about MD5 dedup (Step 2)?

MD5 dedup (`deduplicate_by_md5`) stays **unscoped** — it runs on ALL videos regardless of verification status. This is correct because:

1. MD5 dedup checks if two files are **byte-identical** (same MD5 hash = same file)
2. If two files are byte-identical, they will have the same frames, same clock, same everything
3. Therefore they will have the same `timestamp_verified` value
4. There's no risk of a verified video matching an unverified video by MD5 — if they're byte-identical, they have the same verification status

The MD5 dedup output feeds into the verification split. After MD5 dedup removes true duplicates, the remaining unique videos are split into verified/unverified for perceptual dedup.

#### Task 13: Rank verified videos above unverified — implementation details

**File:** `src/data/mongo_store.py`, inside `recalculate_video_ranks()` (line ~1200)

**Why this matters:** Timestamp verification isn't just a dedup signal — it's a **quality signal for the frontend**. A verified video (clock matches the event time) is objectively more trustworthy than an unverified one (no visible clock — could be celebration close-up, fan recording, or wrong match). The frontend should always show verified clips first.

**Current code** at [mongo_store.py line 1200](src/data/mongo_store.py#L1200):
```python
videos_sorted = sorted(
    videos,
    key=lambda v: (v.get("popularity", 1), v.get("file_size", 0)),
    reverse=True
)
```
Sorts by `(popularity desc, file_size desc)`. A highly-popular unverified video can outrank a less-popular verified one.

**New code — one-line change:**
```python
videos_sorted = sorted(
    videos,
    key=lambda v: (
        v.get("timestamp_verified", False),  # Verified always first
        v.get("popularity", 1),               # Then by popularity
        v.get("file_size", 0),                # Then by quality
    ),
    reverse=True
)
```

Since Python sorts `True > False`, all verified videos rank above all unverified ones. Within each group, the existing popularity + file_size tiebreaker applies.

**Backward compatibility:** Legacy videos without `timestamp_verified` default to `False`, so they sort into the unverified group — same position they'd have had before. No ranking regression for existing data.

**This function is called from:** [upload_workflow.py Step 8 (line ~580)](src/workflows/upload_workflow.py#L580) after every batch upload, via the `recalculate_video_ranks` activity wrapper at [upload.py line 1036](src/activities/upload.py#L1036). No changes needed to the call site or the activity wrapper.
